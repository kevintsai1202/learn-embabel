description: "Use when building, reviewing, or refactoring Embabel + Spring AI JVM agent applications, especially Spring Boot 3.5.x / Java 21 projects that need GOAP planning, @Agent/@Action type-driven flows, Blackboard state, domain @Tool methods, MCP or Agentic RAG integration, prompt testing, observability, production-ready guardrails, @State loops/human-in-the-loop, @Condition boolean gates, Agentic/Progressive tools, streaming output, LLM cost tracking, budget guardrails, MCP server publishing, or concurrent execution. Note: released Embabel (<= 0.4.0) does not run on Spring Boot 4; Boot 4 support arrives with Embabel 2.0 (Spring AI 2.0)."

# Embabel + Spring AI Development

Use this skill to turn a business process into a testable Embabel agent on the JVM. The source model is the `learn-embabel` course: start from engineering boundaries, model the flow with GOAP, implement it as Java records and annotated actions, wire Spring Boot + Spring AI infrastructure, then verify prompts, tools, and operations.

## Source-First Rule

Before writing code:

1. Read the local product/spec files for the target project.
2. If this repo is available, use these source files as the compact reference:
   - `source/course-package/overview.md`
   - `source/course-package/day1/outline.md`
   - `source/course-package/day1/content.md`
   - `teaching-site/course-data.js`
   - `teaching-site/course-package/materials/CustomerCareAgent.java`
3. Confirm the implementation understanding with the developer in concrete terms: target workflow, input/output domain records, terminal goal, model/tool boundaries, and tests.
4. Verify current Embabel, Spring AI, and Spring Boot versions from the project's docs or build files before pinning dependencies. Do not invent versions.

## Version Compatibility (verified 2026-06-12)

- Released Embabel (latest **0.4.0**, Maven Central since 0.2.0) is built on **Spring Boot 3.5.x + Spring AI 1.1.x** (transitively included; do not add a Spring AI BOM yourself).
- **Spring Boot 4 is NOT supported**: compile passes but context startup fails with `NoSuchMethodError: HttpHeaders.addAll(...)` (Spring AI 1.1.x vs Spring Framework 7). Overriding Spring AI to 2.0 milestones/RCs also fails (`OpenAiApi` / `Builder.retryTemplate` removed).
- Boot 4 support is scheduled for **Embabel 2.0.0** (tracking issue embabel/embabel-agent#1052, waiting on Spring AI 2.0 GA). Until then, pin Spring Boot 3.5.x.
- Check latest versions at `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/embabel/agent/embabel-agent-starter/maven-metadata.xml`.

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisite Check（前置條件捷徑）

If the target project **already contains `embabel-agent-starter`** in its build file (pom.xml or build.gradle):
- **Skip step 1** (Fit Assessment) — the decision to use Embabel has already been made.
- **Skip step 5** (Spring Boot + Spring AI Wiring) — starter and model provider are already configured.
- Start directly from **step 2 (GOAP Modeling)**.
- Only run step 1 if the user explicitly asks to re-evaluate whether Embabel is the right fit.

If the project does **not** have the Embabel starter, verify that the scenario genuinely needs Embabel (step 1) before proceeding.

Follow this order unless the user explicitly asks for a narrower review:

1. **Decide if Embabel is appropriate.**
   Use Embabel when the workflow has multiple steps, typed business objects, conditions, review gates, or auditability needs. Use plain Spring AI when it is a single model call or a fixed pipeline.

2. **Model the workflow with GOAP.**
   Create an action table with `Action`, `Preconditions`, `Postconditions`, executor type, failure path, and terminal goal.

3. **Define Java data boundaries.**
   Use records or domain classes for all Blackboard facts. Avoid `Map<String,Object>` and magic string keys.

4. **Implement the agent surface.**
   Use `@Agent`, `@Action`, and `@AchievesGoal`. Method input types are preconditions; return types are postconditions.

5. **Wire Spring Boot and Spring AI.**
   Add Embabel starters, model provider starter, `@EnableAgents`, and `@ConfigurationProperties` for business thresholds and model choices.

6. **Attach tools deliberately.**
   Prefer domain-object `@Tool` for calculations on existing business objects. Use MCP for cross-application reusable tools. Use Agentic RAG / `ToolishRag` for document search where the LLM should decide how to search.

7. **Test the flow before declaring done.**
   Test pure actions with normal unit tests. Test LLM actions by checking prompt construction, model role, exposed tools, and guardrails. Add an integration test for `input -> goal output`.

8. **Add observability and failure handling.**
   Record action execution, LLM call metadata, tool invocation, token/cost where available, failure reason, and audit IDs.

For the full step-by-step checklist, read `references/development-workflow.md`.

## What To Read When

- Read `references/development-workflow.md` when designing or implementing a new Embabel agent.
- Read `references/patterns-and-templates.md` when generating Java records, `@Agent` classes, `application.yml`, Maven snippets, or AI assistant prompts.
- Read `references/testing-and-troubleshooting.md` when adding tests, reviewing reliability, or debugging a stuck plan.
- Read `references/conditions-and-guardrails.md` when an action needs boolean preconditions (`@Condition`, SpEL) or when adding input/output validation guardrails to LLM calls.
- Read `references/states-and-loops.md` when the workflow has looping, branching, human-in-the-loop (`WaitFor`), or state-machine patterns (`@State`).
- Read `references/advanced-features.md` when:
  - You need **Embabel Shell** commands for interactive testing and debugging.
  - An action should fire only on a **specific event** (not just parameter availability) → `trigger` / Reactive Triggers.
  - Agents exposed as **MCP tools need security** → `@SecureAgentTool`.
  - A tool itself needs to **orchestrate sub-tools via LLM** → Agentic Tools (`SimpleAgenticTool`, `PlaybookTool`, `StateMachineTool`).
  - Too many tools overwhelm the LLM and you need **progressive disclosure** → `UnfoldingTool`.
  - Complex prompts require **template management** → Jinja Templates (`rendering()`).
  - Independent sub-tasks should run in **parallel** → `ConcurrentAgentProcess`.
  - The UI needs **streaming output** from the LLM → `StreamingPromptRunnerBuilder`.
  - You need to **inspect LLM reasoning** or validate thinking → `ThinkingResponse` / `ThinkingBlock`.
  - You need to **monitor, log, or transform** LLM/tool interactions → Tool Loop Callbacks / Interceptors.
  - You need to **track LLM cost** or enforce a **budget guardrail** → Cost Tracking / `AgenticEventListener`.
  - You need to **publish agents as MCP servers** or integrate with external systems → MCP Publishing / A2A.

## Hard Rules

- Keep LLM reasoning local to actions; do not let the LLM own the full business workflow.
- Keep action signatures type-driven; the planner cannot reason over hidden map keys.
- Put numeric calculations, policy thresholds, and permission checks in Java code or domain tools, not in prompt text.
- Expose the minimum tools needed for each LLM call.
- Put business thresholds in configuration, not hard-coded prompt strings.
- Add Chinese function-level comments when generating project code for this user's workspace, unless the target project has a stronger local convention.
- Do not call an implementation complete until build/test commands or equivalent project verification have run.

## Output Shape

When asked to design or implement, produce these artifacts as appropriate:

- `GOAP action table`
- domain records/classes
- `@Agent` class with `@Action` methods
- Spring Boot dependency/config notes
- tool exposure plan
- test checklist and runnable tests
- observability/audit checklist
- version-compatibility notes and unresolved assumptions
